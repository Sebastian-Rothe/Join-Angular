        <h2>What is Join?</h2>
        <span>
            <span class="blue-text">Join</span> is a kanban-based project management tool designed and built by a group of 
            dedicated students as part of their web development bootcamp at the Developer Akademie.

            Kanban, a Japanese term meaning "billboard", is a highly effective method to visualize work,
            limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). <span class="blue-text">Join</span>
            leverages the principles of kanban to help users manage their tasks and projects in an intuitive, visual interface.

            It is important to note that <span class="blue-text">Join</span> is designed as an educational 
            exercise and is not intended for extensive business usage. While we strive to ensure the best possible 
            user experience, we cannot guarantee consistent availability, reliability, accuracy, or other aspects of quality regarding <span class="blue-text">Join</span>.

        <h2>How to use it</h2>

        <span>
            Here is a step-by-step guide on how to use
            <span class="blue-text">Join</span>:
        </span>

        <h3>1. Exploring the Board</h3>
        <span>
            When you log in to <span class="blue-text">Join</span>, you'll find a
            default board. This board represents your project and contains four
            default lists: "To Do", "In Progress", “Await feedback” and
            "Done".
        </span>

        <h3>2. Creating Contacts</h3>
        <span>
            In <span class="blue-text">Join</span>, you can add contacts to
            collaborate on your projects. Go to the "Contacts" section, click on
            "New contact", and fill in the required information. Once added, these
            contacts can be assigned tasks and they can interact with the tasks on
            the board.
        </span>

        <h3>3. Adding Cards</h3>
        <span>
            Now that you've added your contacts, you can start adding cards.
            Cards represent individual tasks. Click the "+" button under the
            appropriate list to create a new card. Fill in the task details in the
            card, like task name, description, due date, assignees, etc.
        </span>

        <h3>4. Moving Cards</h3>
        <span>
            As the task moves from one stage to another, you can reflect that on
            the board by dragging and dropping the card from one list to
            another.
        </span>

        <h3>5. Deleting Cards</h3>
        <span>
            Once a task is completed, you can either move it to the "Done" list
            or delete it. Deleting a card will permanently remove it from the
            board. Please exercise caution when deleting cards, as this action is
            irreversible. Remember that using<span class="blue-text"> Join </span> effectively requires consistent updates
            from you and your team to ensure the board reflects the current state of your project. Have more questions about
